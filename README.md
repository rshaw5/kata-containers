:eight_pointed_black_star: This kata is designed for the practitioner to
familiarize themselves with the fundamental concepts of container classes
by creating a basic container from scratch.

To complete this Kata, clone this repo and create one file 
-- `app/Container.php` -- 
that passes all tests in `tests/Unit/ContainerTest.php`.

You can review an example solution in commit 2fa0593.
